a little game for reading in unicode art and shortform text 

medium: games for tiny text consoles, printed on receipts, little messages or tweets. 

audience: me, when late at night i feel sad just before bed and long to check in with something like a long-running sim. my virtual pets.

the game is played by a semiautonomous agent who traverses procedurally generated maps and encounters other semiautonomous agents. in this case we are not the "player" as much as spectators of the player's progress.

three views show progress of gameplay:

- map of the overworld
- encounter 
- stats of player agent and game progress

### overworld map

biomes contain the information to build maps

(...)

### encounters

text depicting events that happen to the player, sketched in minimal atmospheric markov chatter

(...)

### stats

storyteller information, player not in "playable character" but the player in the game whose experience describes the game sequence
